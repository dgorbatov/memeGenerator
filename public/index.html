        <p>This sight was designed by me(Daniel Gorbatov). It uses memes from the meme api
          and was originally created for me to familiarize myself with API's however I have now
          modified it to be hosted on Firebase! For more of my work
          go to my <a href="https://danielgorbatovportfolio.web.app/">portfolio website</a>
